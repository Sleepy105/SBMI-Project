/**
 * @brief Initializes and configures the UART interface to be able to communicate with a HC-05 Bluetooth Module.
 * 
 * This module expects and transmits frames in a 9600N81 setting.
 * It also initializes a interrupt so that when data is received, a jump to the USART_RX_vect vector.
 * A ISR is needed to handle that interruption.
 * CAUTION: "the receive complete routine must read the received data
 * from UDR in order to clear the RXC Flag, otherwise a new interrupt will occur once the interrupt routine
 * terminates" causing a interrupt loop!
